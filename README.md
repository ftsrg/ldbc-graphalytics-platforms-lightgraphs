<p align="center">TDK on benchmarking LDBC Graphalytics with LightGraphs.jl </p>

<h5>1. Introduction</h5>
Talk about the presence and importance of graphs in our everyday life. Name a few fields where graphs, or at least systems that can be considered as graphs, are making huge improvements towards making our planet a better place to live in and helping to connect billions of people.

<h5>2. Preliminaries</h5>
Introduce the definition, properties, metrics of a graph.

<h5>3. Implementation</h5>
This chapter should include the differences between the original LightGraphs.jl's implementation and the LDBC's and its causes on the evaluation of each algorithm.
<h5>4. Evaluation</h5>
Just a random table as an example for the future Adam.

| Result         | BFS | CDLP | LCC | PageRank | SSSP | WCC |
|----------------|-----|------|-----|----------|------|-----|
| LDBC           |     |      |     |          |      |     |
| LightGraphs.jl |     |      |     |          |      |     |

<h5>5. Related Work</h5>
<h5>6. Conclusion and Future Work</h5>
Talk about the future possiblities of this research. Mention either further algorithm optimization or benchmarking stuff.
